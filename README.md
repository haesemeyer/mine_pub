# Model-free identification of neural encoding (MINE)

Repository for the code used in developing, testing and using MINE.


## Main code modules
### mine.py
Simple to use interface to apply MINE to data as described in the last paper figure
and below.
### model.py
Includes the class definition of the CNN that forms the core of MINE.
### taylorDecomp.py
Contains routines for Taylor decomposition and curvature computation.
### perf_nlc_nonlin.py
Contains code to compute the nonlinearity coefficient (NLC).
### utilities.py
Contains general helper functions for data management, clustering, etc.

## Notes

### Interface to MINE
The ```Mine``` class in _mine.py_ is the main interface to MINE.
Data is returned in a ```MineData``` object defined in _mine.py_ as well.
An example for running MINE is given in _processMusall.py_ as well as below:

```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List
from mine import Mine
import h5py
predictors: List[np.ndarray]  # list of predictors
for p in predictors:
    # z-score all predictors
    p -= np.mean(p)
    p /= np.std(p)
responses: np.ndarray  # n_responses * m_timepoints matrix of responses to fit
# z-score responses
responses -= np.mean(responses)
responses /= np.std(responses)
# Create Mine object with the following options:
# Use 2/3 of the timepoints for traning last third for testing
# Use 50 timepoints as model history - NOTE: Shifting predictors relative to responses
#       allows to capture preparatory activity as well see processMusall.py
# Consider any neuron with a test correlation >= 0.5 as fit by MINE
#       only for these neurons will metrics be computed
# Compute Taylor metrics and curvature
# Do not compute complexity
# Return receptive fields
# To calculate Taylor metrics and curvature predict 25 frames ahead
# Compute metrics every five frames
miner = Mine(2.0/3, 50, 0.5, True, False, True, 25, 5)
# analyze data with this MINE object, returning MineData object
mine_data = miner.analyze_data(predictors, responses)
# save mine_data to hdf5 file
with h5py.File("result.hdf5", 'w') as dfile:
    mine_data.save_to_hdf5(dfile)
```

### Figure panel arrangements
Panels for test figures of MINE were generated using _cnn_fit_test.py_ and
_cnn_nonlin_test.py_. Panels for the figure on mouse cortical data were generated
using _plotMusall.py_. Panels for zebrafish figures were generated using
_rwave_plot_panels.py_ and _rspinal_plot_panels.py_.
